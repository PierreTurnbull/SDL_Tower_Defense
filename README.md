# SDL2 Tower Defense

_(On progress)_

## Run program:

``./*.exe``

Error outputs in ``stderr``

## Tech

- C
- SDL 2.0.7
- SDL_Image 2.0.2

## File organisation

**Unique files** are stored in the directory `c`. Example: `./c/main.c`

**Category-specific files** are stored in a directory which name corresponds to a category. Example: `./c/render/render.c`.

**Generic files** are stored in a directory which name is written in uppercase with a leading underscore. Their name starts with the category name in uppercase. Example: `./c/_LOAD/LOAD_rect.c`
