TODO:
- make a unique fill_target function for paths, or change fill_target to have
  only 1 function call to fill the path block simulation
- make functions for room transition
- differenciate *_list from *_data. ex: game.play.target_list && game.play.target_data
- make a data structure to control which fprintf are called
